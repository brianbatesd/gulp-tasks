# gulp-tasks
Gulp tasks and basic project structure.

Compile SASS, watch the files and live reload changes.

Some differences between Gulp and Grunt:

* Gulp has watch built-in
* Gulp requires a sequence to run concurrent tasks
* Gulp dependencies are faster to setup on El Capitan
* Gulp code is arguably more readable
